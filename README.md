## Hello there

Computer scientist by degree, roboticist by heart. Interested in robotics and artificial intelligence. Fascinated by dynamic, nature-inspired control systems and learning algorithms.

I'm currently working on the control of a [drone](https://github.com/sikora-toma/drone-project) I built from scratch, autonomous driving stack for the [Duckietown project](https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown) with the [PoliDuckie team](https://github.com/poliduckie), and navigation for dynamic object inspection drones at FESB, Split.

### Projects
- `drone-project`: a quadcopter built from scratch.
- `Duckietown`: an autonomous driving platform started by MIT holding annual worldwide competitions in various disciplines
  - PoliDuckie team won 5th place in 2021 and presented its work at NeurIPS!
- `agilex-scout-odometry`: odometry computation for AgileX Scout 2.0 robot. 
- `mousecheese`: PlayBot4All team 3 project.
- `gym-pendulum-control`: control theory algorithm implementations on the inverted pendulum problem.
- `Software_Engineering_2_Project_Medvedec_Sikora`: android app built for store customer management during pandemic times. 
- `coding-practice`: personal algorithm practice repo.
