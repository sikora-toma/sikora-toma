## Hi there

Computer scientist by degree, roboticist by heart. Interested in robotics and artificial intelligence. Fascinated by dynamic, nature-inspired control systems and learning algorithms.

I'm currently working on control for a [drone](https://github.com/sikora-toma/drone-project) I built from scratch, autonomous driving stack for the [Duckietown project](https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown) with the [PoliDuckie team](https://github.com/poliduckie), and navigation for infrastructure inspection drones with the [LARICS lab](https://github.com/larics).
